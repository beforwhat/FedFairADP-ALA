# FedFairADP-ALA: Fair and Adaptive Differentially Private Federated Learning

This repository implements **FedFairADP-ALA**, a novel federated learning method that integrates:
- ✅ **Adaptive Clipping DP** (Shapley-guided gradient clipping)
- ✅ **Fair Client Selection** (diversity + participation-aware)
- ✅ **Adaptive Local Aggregation (ALA)**
- ✅ **High-confidence Pseudo Labeling**

Supports **CIFAR-10, EMNIST, SVHN, and FEMNIST** under realistic Non-IID settings.
